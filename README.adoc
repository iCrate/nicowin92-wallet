## Development instructions
The supported version of `node` is `v6`. If you run into build errors, please make sure that you are using NodeV6 by running `node --version`.

`package.json`: This is where scripts that get run when you use `npm run blah` get defined.
It'll be helpful to have an idea of what's available and where the magic `npm run` commands
are coming from. You can run any of those commands without the `npm run` meta-command.

### Dependencies

####  NPM packages
This will install dependencies saved in `package.json` under the `devDependencies` field.
You're going to need these.

```shell
$ npm install
```

If you wind up installing more packages, please
- be sure that they're really important -- we'd like to avoid a pile of "convenience"
  packages; every required package adds complexity.
- use `npm install totally-awesome-and-important` __along with__ `--save` _or_ `--save-dev`.
  That way everyone else will be able to reproduce your totally-awesomely-improved
  setup.

#### Emerald and geth
##### Emerald
If you haven't got `emerald` already installed on your system, you can execute `./dependencies.sh`
to automatically `rustup` and use `cargo` to install `emerald-cli` and move it to the
project's base dir. Note: this command is idempotent __for rust and cargo__ (it won't
try to install cargo if you've already got it), but it will
use cargo's `-f` flag to force install `emerald-cli` and copy that version to the
project directory.

##### Geth
If geth isn't available in your project directory, upon launching the app, it automatically
be downloaded and placed in your project base dir.


### Run for development

Firstly: a couple things aren't working right. If you can fix either of these issues,
@whilei will buy you a beer.

- _Issue 1_: `webpack-dev-server` isn't working right with the current babel-webpack-electron-izing
  setup. So you've got to do your development in Electron for now. Which means you can't run `npm run start:web`. Bummer.

With these caveats in mind, __you can run__:

_Terminal 1_
```shell
# This will begin a live-watching compiler for ./src/ and ./electron/ folders
$ npm run build:all
```

_Terminal 2_
```shell
# This will begin the simulated electron app pulling from those compiled sources.
$ npm run start:electron
```

### Logs

#### Electron and Emerald logs
During development, Electron and Emerald logs are in your Terminal 2 console, they're also
persisted in ~/Library/Logs/EmeraldWallet/log.log. This is the same for production.

#### Geth logs
During development, you'll find geth's logs in `./logs` right in the project base directory.
In production, logs will be nestled in `~/Library/Application Support/EmeraldWallet/`.

### Building alternatively

You can also use a variety of alternate build options, eg.

```
$ npm run build:all:nowatch
$ npm run build:web
```

### Building distributions in development
You can run a distribution build in your development environment. Assuming
you've already compiled `./src/` and `./electron/`, you'll be able to run:

```
$ npm run dist
```

This command will build for _your current system_. Note that there are configurations for
several systems (OSX, Linux, Windows) specified in the `"build"` field of `package.json`, but the `dist` command will by default only build for the system it's on.

Note: If you're developing on OSX and have a developer signing identity on your machine, you can
optionally disable that with `CSC_IDENTITY_AUTO_DISCOVERY=false`.

OSX is also able to build for Linux. Add `-ml` to that raw command to build for
both OSX and Linux at the same time.

### Troubleshooting
Some preliminary things to try in case you run into issues:

- Clear out any persisted settings or userdata from previous trials
 * OSX: `~/Library/Application Support/EmeraldWallet`
 * Linux: `~/.config/EmeraldWallet`
 * Windows: `%APPDATA%\EmeraldWallet`



## Run tests

```
npm run test:watch
```

or for single run:
```
npm test
```

### Parity

`./parity --chain=classic`

Use `--rpccorsdomain` option to configure CORS.

Example: `./parity --chain=classic --rpccorsdomain=*` allow requests from any domain
